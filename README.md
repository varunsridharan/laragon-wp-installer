# Laragon WP Installer

This is a simple script written in ***PHP*** using which you can install WordPress Quickly In Localhost

## Why Its Archived

Since i :heart: using [Laragon](https://laragon.org/) so much for my local development 
I decided to create a full fledged web application for Laragon using which you can
create VHosts, install wordpress & so on.

> Due to which this script is now Archived
